<h1>Why secure early bonding is essential for babies</h1>

<p class="theme">What happens between conception and the age of two shapes the adult a child will become</p>

	<p>The greatest health challenge of our time is securing good mental health for our nation. To achieve good mental health, we should look no further than where it all begins – the conception of a baby.</p>

<p>Secure early bonding is the difference between the baby that grows up a secure, emotionally capable adult, and a baby that will become a depressive, anxious child, who will not cope well with life's ups and downs. In the most difficult cases, this baby is more likely to later experience criminality, substance abuse or depressive problems.</p>

<p>Human babies are unique in the animal kingdom in the extent of their underdevelopment at birth. But the physical underdevelopment is only a tiny part of it. The human brain is only partially formed when you are born. The earliest experiences of the human baby have a lifelong impact on their mental and emotional health.</p>

<h4>Babies start interpreting their world immediately</h4>
<p>When a baby cries, it doesn't know it is wet, tired, hungry, bored or hot – it just knows something is wrong, and it relies on a loving adult to soothe its feelings. The baby whose basic needs are met learns that the world is a good place, and he or she will retain this sense for life, as almost an instinct.</p>

<p>The baby who is neglected or abused cannot regulate its own feelings. If its needs are not met it will scream louder and louder and eventually take refuge in sleep. A baby left to continually scream will experience raised levels of the stress hormone cortisol, which can damage the immune system</p>

<p>The "social" part of the brain only starts to develop at around six months. Where a baby does not receive any attention, this part of the brain does not grow and may never grow.</p>

<p>Shocking research suggests that in Britain 40% of children are not securely attached at the age of five. Of course this doesn't mean they will all go on to have behavioural or relationship problems, but they will be less robust in their emotional make up to meet the challenges and disappointments of life.</p>

<p>If we want to change our society for the better, we must focus on the crucial period between conception and the age of two.</p>

<h4>Prevention is best</h4>

<p>Prevention is not only kinder, it's also far cheaper than cure. Each looked-after child costs the taxpayer around £347 a day. Each adult prison inmate costs the taxpayer around £112 per day.</p>

<p>What about other unmeasured costs? Research shows that more than 80% of long-term prison inmates have attachment problems that stem from babyhood; there is now evidence to suggest you can predict two thirds of future chronic criminals by behaviour seen at the age of two. </p>

<p>The question is, what can be done about it? This is where the vision of Parent Infant Partnerships (Pips) comes in – to help parents form a loving and secure bond with their babies.</p>

<p>It ought to be natural to form that secure bond. But post-natal depression, problems with conception or the birth experience, domestic violence and issues of poverty can all get in the way. And one of the biggest obstacles to forming that secure bond is when Mum didn't have a secure relationship with her own mother. This truly is a cycle of deprivation that is passed down through generations.</p>

<p>Therapeutic support can and does break that cycle, helping the carer come to terms with their own feelings and fears.</p>

<p>The Oxford Parent Infant Partnership (Oxpip), founded in 1998, and her baby sister in Northamptonshire (Norpip), are social enterprises. They are funded half by contracts with statutory service providers and half by fundraising efforts. Pips work because they are set up and run by local people within their community. Oxpip and Norpip each have a board of volunteer trustees, who give time, money and knowledge to establishing and developing the service.</p>

<p>Oxpip has developed excellent training programmes that teach professionals to spot early attachment problems as well as train parent-infant psychotherapists.</p>

<p>Pips can determine their own fate. They accept self referrals from sometimes desperate parents, from health visitors and midwives who are key to identifying problems early, and also from social workers who deal with the most difficult and unhappy cases. They negotiate contracts to take referrals from different organisations, from the county council to the GP commissioners to children's centres.</p>

<h4>Taking Pips nationwide</h4>

<p>Earlier this year, I hosted jointly with the University of Northampton a major conference on Pips. I was delighted to announce that we will be establishing a new charitable foundation, Parent Infant Partnership UK – Pip UK for short – which will provide co-funding and practical support to those local authority areas that wish to establish their own early-years service.</p>

<p>Several of my MP colleagues have already expressed an interest in learning more about the Pip model. The University of Northampton has created a Pip toolkit – a guide to how to establish a Pip.</p>

<p>Pips are, of course, not the only model for delivering therapeutic support to struggling families. </p>

<p>What is clear to all those involved in supporting the earliest relationships is that the awareness of the critical period from conception to age two is not widely understood in our NHS and public services. Training provision for professionals is not yet good enough.</p>

<p>Provision of therapeutic support is variable. In many areas, for support to be made available, the family must already be in severe crisis. The bar is set too high.</p>

<p>Also, medium-term funding commitments are often impossible to achieve. Commissioners have not yet fully recognised the huge financial saving that would result from early intervention.</p>

<p>The challenge is to build a stronger and happier society. What we do to intervene between conception and age two is all about building the emotional capacity of an infant. What we do after the age of two is mostly to undo damage done previously.</p>

<p>If we work together, we really can change society for the better.</p>
