<h3>Testimonials</h3>
<p>Dorset Parent Infant Partnership has come far from the early days of individual helpers. We now have a coordinated network of professionals working together and making great strides in the right direction. Below is the view of one parent on what can be achieved through parent infant therapy.</p>

<p><i>“It has completely changed my life. I feel so happy to have Bella and Jacob, so we can be a family again. I couldn’t really see how bad I was, but Parent Infant Psychotherapy was the essential aid in my recovery and I totally love being a parent now. I think I would have lost Bella into care if it hadn’t been for this unique service” </i></p>
