<h3>Dr Andy Mayers - Chair of Trustees</h3>

He actively campaigns for raising better awareness for mental health, and challenges stigma and discrimination. He serves on several local and national advisory groups for maternal mental illness. He is a Fellow of the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (RSA), as a reflection of his work campaigning for better mental health. He is Patron for the Samaritans of Bournemouth and District and Patron and for Dorset Mind. He is also Chair of trustees for ActsFast, a charity based in Dorset that supports families who care for child sexual abuse victims. He works closely with Dorset HealthCare University NHS Foundation NHS Trust and Dorset Police (in association with Dorset Police and Crime Commissioner) on the mental health street triage. He delivers mental health training programmes for health professionals (including health visitors and midwives), through Bournemouth University and Dorset HealthCare. He works closely with the perinatal mother and baby unit in Bournemouth.</p>

<p>Andy, who is married with 4 adult children and 4 grandchildren (with another on the way) says: “I joined the Board because I am passionate about improving the relationship between mothers and their infants, especially where that has been compromised by poor perinatal mental health. I believe that DorPIP is uniquely placed to work with other providers and support groups across Dorset, to improve the lives of families when they need it most. It has been exciting to be involved in the conception of this service.”</p>

<h3>Viv Allen - Founder</h3>
</a>
<p>Viv has worked in personal development and mental health for many years.  She has developed her knowledge about the importance of safe and secure bonds through her work as a counsellor and also from her lived experience.  When Viv had her own children she suffered from Post Natal Depression and other stressors on the care giving relationship.  Through her own struggles and from working with many adults suffering from mental ill-health Viv has developed a passion to ensure that every baby has the best possible start in life through the establishment of safe and secure relationships with their primary carers.</p>

<p>Viv who has 2 daughters says “I wanted to establish a specialist service in Dorset to address the needs of the many families who need extra support to help ensure that they develop safe, secure relationships with their infant.  This work is important for our children, our communities and for society as a whole.  Studies have shown that people who are securely attached meet the world from a stronger base making better life choices from diet, exercise to education and career aspirations.  The value to society in raising strong emotionally resilient children will be seen in generations to come.  For commissioners the rate of return to investment in human capital is highest in programs targeted towards the earliest years.  It is sound social policy and economics to ensure that every parent who needs support can access support, early intervention is the key to success."</p>
